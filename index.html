                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Economics from City College of 
                        New York. During my studies, I gained expertise in Python and SQL. 
                        I also took courses in business analytics, quantitative finance, 
                        and financial analysis.</p>

                    <h3>My Vision: Curiosity</h3>
                    <p>In a world that often equates success with inherent intelligence, 
                        I embrace a different perspective - one deeply rooted in the belief 
                        that curiosity is the key. The essence of expertise and growth 
                        is not predetermined by some capacity for knowledge, but in the relentless 
                        pursuit of understanding driven by an insatiable curiosity.</p>

                    <p> In Albert Einstein's words: 'Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a 
                        fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing 
                        that it is stupid.' This quote resonates with my core belief that traditional 
                        measures of intelligence cannot encompass each individual's diverse and 
                        unique strengths.</p>
