                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Economics from City College of 
                        New York. During my studies, I gained expertise in Python and SQL. 
                        I also took courses in business analytics, quantitative finance, 
                        and financial analysis.</p>

                    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>When I've exhausted myself from work and life's duties, I escape to the things that bring me joy
                        and peace. I mainly enjoy practing on my digital-piano, and playing chess. From time to time
                        I like playing video games, watching movies, and reading books. But my favorite pastime is exploring
                        the city; this also ties in with traveling, going to different countries, observing different cultures, 
                        and experiencing new horizons. Exploration creates a deeper connection with the world around me.

                    <h3>My Vision: The Power of Curiosity and Passion</h3>
                    <p>In a world that often equates success with inherent intelligence, 
                        I embrace a different perspective - one deeply rooted in the belief 
                        that curiosity is the key. The true essence of expertise and growth 
                        lies not in a predetermined capacity for knowledge but in the relentless 
                        pursuit of understanding driven by an insatiable curiosity. I find profound 
                        wisdom in Albert Einstein's words: 'Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a 
                        fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing 
                        that it is stupid.' This quote resonates with my core belief that traditional 
                        measures of intelligence cannot encompass each individual's diverse and 
                        unique strengths. It's a reminder that everyone shines in their own way, 
                        and judging or comparing using a singular standard is unfair and limiting. 
                        My philosophy centers on the power of competence fueled by curiosity. 
                        It's the idea that our ability to excel and innovate stems not from a 
                        static measure of intelligence but from a dynamic and passionate engagement 
                        with the world around us. It's about asking questions, seeking new 
                        experiences, and being open to learning and relearning.</p>
